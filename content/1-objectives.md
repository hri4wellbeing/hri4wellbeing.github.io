This workshop's main goal is to bring together a multidisciplinary community to identify and overcome major challenges in HRI research to investigate the applications of robots for wellbeing in the real world. The specific topics of this workshop sought to address the following open challenges:

#### 1. What are the main opportunities and challenges in the deployment of robots for wellbeing in the real world? 
The deployment and adoption of robots for wellbeing in the real world have many potentials but also challenges. This workshop seeks to draw a research agenda that encompasses the directions for robotic applications for wellbeing highlighted in the literature and help researchers in the field of robotics identify opportunities and challenges to address in their future work.

#### 2. How can we reduce the gap between people’s expectations and the reality of robotic applications?
Despite the widespread use of robots in our society, the mismatch between people’s expectations and reality still exists. People showed high and, at times, unrealistic expectations towards robots and this priming – due to, for example, tech giant demos – may form one of the barriers to the adoption of robots in real-world settings. In this workshop, we will seek to discuss how as researchers, we can reduce this gap to make people more aware of the actual capabilities that robots can be endowed with to date.

#### 3. How can we inform the design of robots for wellbeing, grounding it in the psychology/psychiatry literature?
As robotic applications become more prevalent in daily life, it is becoming clearer how they can support humans' physical and mental wellbeing. However, robots should be designed to promote wellbeing in line with psychological theories and methods. For this reason, the HRI community should be more aware of the need for multidisciplinary research to design robots for improving wellbeing, which will be one of the main highlights of our workshop.

The main objective of this workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to identify and address key challenges for studying socio-emotionally adaptive robots for wellbeing and its relevant aspect for socially assistive robots in the lab and in the field. The workshop aims at (1) including the advances in affective computing and machine learning into social robotics context; (2) investigating the crucial topic of wellbeing  in clinical and non-clinical contexts during a post-pandemic era; and (3) advancing the field of social robotics in a situated context focusing on open challenges.

#### 1. Adaptive and Socio-emotional Robot Behaviors to Promote Wellbeing 
Despite their popularity in the machine learning community, adaptation and emotional  capabilities have not been explored largely in robotic applications. For robotic agents, learning adaptive and socio-emotional behaviors raises new challenges due to the critical issues of their embodiment and their social interaction with humans. 
This workshop seeks to draw a research agenda that encompasses the directions for machine learning methods highlighted in the literature and help researchers in the field of robotics to identify priorities and challenges to address in their future work.

#### 2. The Role of Socially Assistive Robots for Wellbeing 
Within the HRI community, a promising venue to assist people with special needs during their everyday life tasks is Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR). SARs have been explored mainly for home assistance for the elderly and therapeutic interventions for children with autism.  Past works have also focused on using socially assistive robots for wellbeing. However, the understanding of their role in context is still in its infancy. With this open challenge in mind, this workshop will focus on better highlighting (i) which are the different roles a socially assistive robot can assume into specific context (e.g., in-home, therapeutic centers) to promote wellbeing (e.g., companion/peer, assistant, coach) and (ii) how the user perception of the robot changes across the different roles.

#### 3. Opportunities and Challenges of Designing Robots to Promote Wellbeing 
The robotic applications are spreading out into our everyday lives, leading to a greater understanding that robotic progress influences the human physical and social environments. Nowadays, the robotic field is pivoting towards the wellbeing and healthcare of the present and future generations. In this context, one of the main opportunities and challenges is the reflection on the design of robots for promoting wellbeing, which will be one of the important highlights of our workshop.
