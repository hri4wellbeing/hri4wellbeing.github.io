Maja Matarić is a Chan Soon-Shiong distinguished professor of Computer Science, Neuroscience, and Pediatrics at the University of Southern California, founding director of the USC Robotics and Autonomous Systems Center (rasc.usc.edu), co-director of the USC Robotics Research Lab (robotics.usc.edu), past interim Vice President of Research (Jan 2020-Jul 2021), past Vice Dean for Research (Jul 2006-Dec 2019) and past President of the USC faculty and the Academic Senate (2005-06). She received her PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from MIT in 1994, MS in Computer Science from MIT in 1990, and BS in Computer Science from the University of Kansas in 1987. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), IEEE, AAAI, and ACM, and recipient of the US Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) from President Obama, and the Okawa Foundation, NSF Career, the MIT TR100 Innovation, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early Career, the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision Innovation, Viterbi School Service Award and Junior Research Awards, and is featured in the documentary movie "Me & Isaac Newton." She is an advisory editor of three major journals and has published extensively in various areas of robotics. Prof. Mataric' is actively involved in K-12 outreach, leading the USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center and developing free curricular materials for elementary and middle-school robotics courses in order to engage student interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. Her Interaction Lab's research into socially assistive robotics is aimed at endowing robots with the ability to help people reach their potential through individual assistance (for convalescence, rehabilitation, training, and education) and team cooperation (for habitat monitoring and emergency response). Research details are found at robotics.usc.edu/interaction.

## Invited Talks
The multidisciplinary nature of this workshop brings together the synergy of multiple areas, such as Psychology and Machine Learning.  For this reason, besides the keynote speakers, we invite two experts in the field of Psychology and Machine Learning to provide their perspectives via a short presentation (around 15 minutes):

<!--Open floor discussion: This workshop seeks to address the open challenges reported above (RC1 - RC3) with the contributed papers and the invited speaker presentations. During an open floor discussion, we will address those challenges and discuss possible solutions. Those challenges are provisional, and will change according to the keynote speakers’ talks and the paper submissions. 
We will divide the audience into three groups (breakout rooms in case of virtual or hybrid conference) that will be assigned to one of the research challenges delivered in the keynote speaker’s talks. The keynote speaker will also join their own topic group (provisional to their availability). At the end of the group discussion, we will rejoin the main workshop session, and each group will present their discussion’s outcomes. Also the attendees who will be present in-person will be assigned to a group team. For the sake of simplicity, we will create in-person groups, and online groups. However, the final main discussion will include both in-person and virtual attendees.
Workshop proceedings: We will include the workshop papers into the Workshop Proceedings collection available on arXiv. The papers could be 2-4 pages for short contributions and 6-8 pages for long paper contributions. Authors should use the RO-MAN template (http://www.smile.unina.it/ro-man2022/call-for-papers/) for the submission. Authors will be invited to present their accepted papers in a 15 minutes oral presentation during this workshop.
Special Issue: We want to publish a Special Issue containing contributions from workshop participants as well as other researchers working on related works to collect the knowledge and insights gained during the workshop. We are currently preparing a Special Issue proposal to be submitted to the International Journal of Social robotics. -->
