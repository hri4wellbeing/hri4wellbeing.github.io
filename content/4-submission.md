## Call for Papers 
This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the fields of Social Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, Affective Computing, Wellbeing, Design, Adaptive Machine Learning, Ethics, Social Sciences, etc. to discuss topics related to the use of robots as assistant/companion/coach for wellbeing, the issues they face to personalize to the individual avoiding to being perceived as antisocial or asocial in the domestic context. 

We invite authors to submit their contributions either regular paper (6-8 pages long) or position papers (2-4 pages long), using the format provided by [RO-MAN](http://www.smile.unina.it/ro-man2022/call-for-papers/). All papers are to be submitted via the submission system of [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/cfp/hri4wellbeing). 

In tandem with this workshop, we are preparing a Special Issue proposal that we have submitted to the [International Journal of Social Robotics](https://www.springer.com/journal/12369/updates/20296154). Selected papers from the workshop will be considered for this special issue. Submissions to the special issue will go through a separate peer review process.

## Special Issue
The Special issue has already opened and will stay open until November 30th, 2022 - you can submit to the special issue without submitting to/attending the workshop - but of course we encourage you to do both! All submitted papers will be reviewed as soon as they are received and accepted papers will be published online whilst tthe complete Special Issue is published.
