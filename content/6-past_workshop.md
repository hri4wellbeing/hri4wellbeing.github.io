Micol Spitale is currently a PostDoc at the Affective Intelligence & Robotics Laboratory (AFAR Lab), Department of Computer Science & Technology of the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of professor Hatice Gunes. Her research focuses on developing a Socio-emotionally Adaptive Robotic (ARoEQ) platform that can foster wellbeing through coaching and psychologically-proven interventions. She has just finalised her Ph.D. (end of October 2021) in Information Technology (Computer Science and Engineering Area) affiliated with IBM Italy and co-funded by EIT Digital (started in November 2018), I3Lab,  Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering at Politecnico di Milano. She has worked as a researcher assistant for six months on different research projects, such as social robots to convey emotions and multisensory rooms for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Then, she won a Ph.D. fellowship, and she started her Ph.D. on “Conversational Technologies for Children with Cognitive Disabilities”. During her second year of Ph.D., she spent six months at the University of Southern California (USC) in the Interaction Lab. She explored the use of robots to support children with cognitive disabilities. Finally, her doctoral thesis focuses on applying conversational Socially Assistive Robots to assess and train the linguistic skills of children with language impairments.
