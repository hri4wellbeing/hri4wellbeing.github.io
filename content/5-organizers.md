Her research activities are grounded in the Social Robotics area. She has a strong background in affective computing, child-robot interaction, and machine learning applications to human behavioural analysis. Her current research focuses on developing socio-emotionally adaptive robots that can foster wellbeing through coaching and psychologically proven interventions. She has been awarded “cum laude” a Ph.D. in Information Technology, Computer Science and Engineering Area at the Politecnico di Milano, co-funded by IBM Italy and EIT Digital, in October 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Franca Garzotto. During her Ph.D., she spent several months at the University of Southern California (USC) in the Interaction Lab as a visiting Ph.D. student, where she explored the use of robots for eliciting empathy during storytelling activities under the supervision of the Prof. Maja Matarić. She published works in top conferences (HRI, ACII, RO-MAN) and journals (MTAP, ACM-CS, THRI), gaining over 140 citations (h-index=7). She has participated in European projects and EPSRC UK-funded projects. While in Cambridge, she has been awarded the EPSRC IAA Impact Grant for Early Career Researchers (25KGBP). She is currently the lead guest editor of the International Journal of Social Robotics Special Issue on Embodied Agents for Wellbeing.

{% include figure.html img="SooyeonJeong.jpg" caption="" width="25%" %}

Sooyeon Jeong is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies in Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her research focuses on designing and deploying interactive agents that can improve people's lives by providing personalized support based on each user's needs, traits and behaviors. Dr. Jeong deploys these agents "in-the-wild" to evaluate how they build relationships/rapport with people over time and improve their wellbeing, health and learning. She aims to build relational technologies to be more than just tools and become helpful companions for people by continuously adapting themselves to help users achieve their health goals. Dr. Jeong received a S.B. and a M.Eng. from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT, and a S.M. and a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT Media Lab. In Fall 2023, she will be a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University.

Shelly Levy-Tzedek is an associate professor and the director of the Cognition, Aging & Rehabilitation Laboratory at Ben Gurion University. Prof. Levy-Tzedek completed her undergraduate studies, summa cum laude, at UC Berkeley, where she won the Bioengineering departmental citation medal. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), she completed her M.S. and her Ph.D. degrees as an MIT Presidential Fellow and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute fellow, in the Biomedical Engineering department, and was a guest professor at the University of Freiburg in Germany as part of the Marie S. Curie FRIAS COFUND Fellowship Program in 2018-19. Prof. Levy-Tzedek was chosen as one of Israel's most promising 40-under-40 by The Marker Magazine, won an award from the Paedagogica Foundation's special program entitled "Initiative for Excellence in the Negev", and the Toronto Prize for excellence in research. Her work is supported by national and international foundations - private and public. Her lab studies the effects of age and disease (in particular, Parkinson's disease & stroke) on the control of body movement, and how to best employ robotics to facilitate a fast and efficient rehabilitation process. She takes a multi-disciplinary approach to her studies: the students on her team come from varied backgrounds, including physical therapy, engineering and psychology, and she collaborates with faculty members from Israel, Canada, England, the United States and Germany who come from diverse fields such as Industrial Engineering, Psychology, Computer Science, Robotics, Education and Philosophy.
